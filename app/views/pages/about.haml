      %p.text-gray-700.mb-4
        FlowMetr started with a simple idea: make it easier to understand how systems behave as they run. We wanted a tool that could show us the real-time flow of processes, help identify when things break, and do it all without getting in the way.

      %p.text-gray-700.mb-4
        We've built FlowMetr for developers, ops teams, and anyone who needs visibility into how their workflows actually perform. You can set up custom flows, define key checkpoints, and track every run — successful or not — in one clean interface.

        Thanks for using FlowMetr. We hope it helps you stay confident and informed about your systems.
